Chap 6: Joint Air Operations Planning (JP 3-30, 3-52, 3-60) The JFACC uses the JFC’s mission, commander’s estimate and objectives, com mander’s intent, CONOPS, and the components’ objectives to develop a course of action  (COA). When the JFC approves the JFACC’s COA, it becomes the basis for more de tailed joint air operations planning—expressing what, where, and how joint air operations  will affect the adversary or current situation.  
The JFACC is responsible for planning joint air operations and uses the joint operation  planning process for air (JOPPA) to develop a JAOP that guides employment of the air  capabilities and forces made available to accomplish missions assigned by the JFC. The  JFC will normally delegate the authority to conduct execution planning, coordination, and  deconfliction associated with joint air targeting to the JFACC and will ensure that this  process is a joint effort. The joint air tasking cycle process provides an iterative, cyclic  process for the planning, apportionment, allocation, coordination, and tasking of joint air  missions and sorties within the guidance of the JFC. 
Chap 3: Command & Control (Annexes 3-30 & 3-52) Command and control (C2) and organization are inextricably linked. Forces should be  organized around the principle of unity of command. Clear lines of authority, with clearly  identified commanders at appropriate echelons exercising appropriate control, are es sential to achieving unity of effort, reducing confusion, and maintaining priorities. Airspace  control is defined as “capabilities and procedures used to increase operational effectiveness ness by promoting the safe, efficient, and flexible use of airspace. 
Chap 4: Airpower (Annexes 2-0, 3-01, 3-03, 3-04, 3-05, 3-12,  3-13, 3-14, 3-17, 3-50, 3-51, 3-61, 3-17, 3-72) 
Airpower entails the use of military power and influence to achieve objectives at all levels  by controlling and exploiting air, space, and cyberspace. Airpower is a vital component  of successful military operations and can often provide for decisive, rapid, and more ef ficient attainment of enduring advantage. It has been an asymmetric advantage for the  United States in many operations. Defeating enemy forces has traditionally been the most  important of the tasks assigned to the military, and while that remains vitally important,  national strategic guidance increasingly emphasizes the importance of preventing conflict,  deterring adversaries, and shaping the operational environment so as to obtain continuing  strategic advantage for the US and its allies.
